# Solution: @Observable Environment Feedback Loop in NavigationStack

## Problem

### Symptoms

- `UIObservationTrackingFeedbackLoopDetected` warning/crash on app launch
- Console: "Object receiving repeated [layout] invalidations: NavigationStackHostingController"
- Continuous layout invalidation cycle in the Today tab

### Root Cause

`DashboardView` read an `@Observable` ViewModel property directly in `.environment()`:

```swift
.environment(\.weatherAtmosphere, viewModel.weatherAtmosphere)
```

The `.environment()` modifier propagates to the **entire NavigationStack subtree**. When `loadData()` modified `weatherAtmosphere` (first resetting to `.default`, then setting the fetched value), it triggered:

1. Environment value changes → all children invalidated
2. NavigationStack re-layouts children
3. DashboardView body re-evaluates → re-reads `viewModel.weatherAtmosphere`
4. Step 3 happens during step 2's layout → **feedback loop**

### Why `.environment()` is uniquely dangerous

Regular `@Observable` reads in body (e.g., `Text(viewModel.title)`) only invalidate the current view. But `.environment()` propagates down the entire subtree. When a NavigationStack is the parent, modifying the environment value during its layout cycle creates a re-entrant invalidation that SwiftUI detects as a feedback loop.

## Solution

### Changes Made

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `DashboardView.swift` | Added `@State private var cachedWeatherAtmosphere: WeatherAtmosphere = .default` | Decouple environment from observation tracking |
| `DashboardView.swift` | `.environment(\.weatherAtmosphere, cachedWeatherAtmosphere)` | Read from @State (no observation tracking) |
| `DashboardView.swift` | `.onChange(of: viewModel.weatherAtmosphere) { cachedWeatherAtmosphere = $1 }` | Sync cache on next render pass |

### Key Code

```swift
// Before: direct @Observable read in .environment() — FEEDBACK LOOP
.environment(\.weatherAtmosphere, viewModel.weatherAtmosphere)

// After: @State cache breaks the observation tracking during layout
@State private var cachedWeatherAtmosphere: WeatherAtmosphere = .default

.environment(\.weatherAtmosphere, cachedWeatherAtmosphere)
.onChange(of: viewModel.weatherAtmosphere) { _, newValue in
    cachedWeatherAtmosphere = newValue
}
```

### Why This Works

`@State` changes are coalesced to the next render pass. So when `loadData()` modifies `viewModel.weatherAtmosphere`:
1. `.onChange` fires and sets `cachedWeatherAtmosphere`
2. But the environment update is deferred to the next layout pass
3. The NavigationStack completes its current layout without re-entrancy
4. On the next pass, the environment updates cleanly

## Prevention

### Rule: Never read @Observable properties directly in `.environment()`

When passing `@Observable` values through `.environment()`, always cache in `@State` first:

```swift
// BAD: observation tracking during environment propagation
.environment(\.myKey, viewModel.myProperty)

// GOOD: @State cache breaks the tracking cycle
@State private var cachedValue = MyDefault.value
.environment(\.myKey, cachedValue)
.onChange(of: viewModel.myProperty) { _, new in cachedValue = new }
```

This pattern is only needed for `.environment()`. Regular body reads (`Text(viewModel.title)`) don't need caching because they don't propagate to child views.

## Second Instance: Cross-Observable Sparkline Read-Through

### Problem

After the weatherAtmosphere fix, the feedback loop persisted when entering Settings. Root cause: `DashboardViewModel.conditionSparkline` was a computed property that read through to `ScoreRefreshService.conditionSparkline` (a different `@Observable`):

```swift
// FEEDBACK LOOP: cross-observable read-through
var conditionSparkline: HourlySparklineData {
    scoreRefreshService?.conditionSparkline ?? .empty
}
```

SwiftUI observation tracked `ScoreRefreshService.conditionSparkline` through the computed property. When `ScoreRefreshService` updated the sparkline (from refresh stream or `recordSnapshot()` → `scheduleSparklineReload()`), it directly invalidated DashboardView, bypassing the `@State` ViewModel coalescing.

### Fix

Convert to stored property with explicit sync:

```swift
// SAFE: stored property, no cross-observable chain
private(set) var conditionSparkline: HourlySparklineData = .empty

private func syncSparklines() {
    conditionSparkline = scoreRefreshService?.conditionSparkline ?? .empty
}
```

Called at end of `loadData()`. Sparkline may be slightly behind `ScoreRefreshService` between refreshes — acceptable for hourly sparkline data.

## Third Instance: Preference→@State→Body Cascade During Navigation Push

### Problem

After fixes 1–2 and removal of the `sectionVisibilityHash` animation, the feedback loop recurred when entering Settings. Root cause: `@State heroFrame` updated via `.onPreferenceChange(TabHeroFramePreferenceKey.self)` created a continuous invalidation cycle during NavigationStack push animations.

The cycle:
1. NavigationStack push animation starts → content slides
2. Hero card frame changes in coordinate space → `GeometryReader` reports new frame
3. `.onPreferenceChange` fires → `heroFrame = newFrame` (writes to `@State`)
4. `@State` mutation → DashboardView body re-evaluates → reads ~20 `@Observable` ViewModel properties
5. If any ViewModel property changed from in-flight async work (enhanceCoachingTask, sparkline reload), observation triggers another invalidation
6. NavigationStack receives repeated [layout] invalidations → feedback loop

This pattern existed in ALL 4 tab root views (Dashboard, Activity, Wellness, Life) but manifested most severely in DashboardView due to its ~20 `@Observable` property reads amplifying the cascade.

### Fix

Replace the three-step pattern with `.backgroundPreferenceValue`:

```swift
// BEFORE: preference → @State → body re-eval → layout → preference (LOOP)
@State private var heroFrame: CGRect?
// ...
.onPreferenceChange(TabHeroFramePreferenceKey.self) { heroFrame = $0 }
.background {
    TabWaveBackground()
        .environment(\.tabHeroStartLineInset, heroFrame.map(TabHeroStartLine.inset(for:)))
}

// AFTER: preference read stays in background closure — no body re-eval
.backgroundPreferenceValue(TabHeroFramePreferenceKey.self) { heroFrame in
    TabWaveBackground()
        .environment(\.tabHeroStartLineInset, heroFrame.map(TabHeroStartLine.inset(for:)))
}
```

`backgroundPreferenceValue` reads the preference directly in the background view builder. When the preference changes, **only the background closure re-evaluates** — the parent view's body does NOT re-evaluate. No `@State` intermediate means no body invalidation.

Applied to all 4 tab root views: DashboardView, ActivityView, WellnessView, LifeView.

Also removed the dead `sectionVisibilityHash` computed property (23 lines) which had ~17 unnecessary `@Observable` reads per body evaluation.

## Lessons Learned

1. `.environment()` has subtree-wide propagation — treat it differently from regular property reads
2. `@Observable` + `.environment()` + async mutation = guaranteed feedback loop potential
3. The `@State` cache + `.onChange` pattern is the standard SwiftUI fix for `.environment()` cases
4. Initial `@State` default must match the ViewModel's initial value to avoid flash of wrong state
5. **Cross-observable computed read-throughs** also create feedback loops: when ViewModel A's computed property reads from `@Observable` B, SwiftUI tracks both. Updates to B invalidate the View even though A's `@State` wrapping should coalesce them
6. Fix for cross-observable: convert computed → stored property with explicit sync at stable points (end of `loadData()`, `.onChange`, etc.)
7. **`.onPreferenceChange` → `@State` in views with heavy `@Observable` tracking** is a latent feedback loop source. During navigation animations, geometry preferences change continuously. Each `@State` write triggers body re-evaluation, which re-tracks `@Observable` properties, amplifying any concurrent mutation into cascading invalidations
8. **Use `.backgroundPreferenceValue` / `.overlayPreferenceValue`** instead of `.onPreferenceChange` + `@State` when the preference value only needs to flow to background/overlay views. These APIs confine re-evaluation to the closure scope without invalidating the parent body
9. **Dead computed properties still register observation tracking** if accidentally called — remove them promptly after their sole consumer is deleted
